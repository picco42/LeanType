## 🚀 What's New

### 👆 Gesture & Swipe Engine
*   **Pure-Java Fallback Engine**: Added a pure-Java fallback gesture typing engine (`SwipeGestureEngine`) so gesture typing works out of the box without requiring native libraries.
*   **Engine Selection Toggle**: Added settings to toggle between native and fallback gesture typing, dynamically hiding unnecessary settings like native library loader.
*   **Self-Learning**: Enabled swipe gesture self-learning by indexing user history and personal dictionaries.
*   **Ranking & Matching accuracy**: Added endpoint-weighted L2 scoring, shape length mismatch penalty, sequence matching penalty, next-word bigram prediction boost, and forgiving start/end matching.
*   **Index Building Optimizations**: Sped up index building, pruned low-frequency entries, cached charToPos, and optimized memory allocations to avoid ANRs.

### 🛠️ Visual & Keyboard Settings
*   **Space-Strip Punctuation Fix**: Restored manual space handling! Spaces are no longer stripped before punctuation marks if they were entered manually (only auto-inserted spaces are stripped).
*   **Toolbar Longpress Toggle**: Added settings toggle to disable long-press hint dots on toolbar keys.
*   **Blocked Words Screen**: Display total count of blocked words in the dictionary settings title.
*   **Text Edit persistence**: Added a toggle to persist text edit mode.
